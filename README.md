## About Me
I'm currently learning Microsoft Power Platform (Power Apps, SharePoint, Power Automate) as part of a personal and professional development journey.

## 🔧 Project in Progress
I'm building a no-code business application prototype to manage administrative workflows (qualification requests, commissions, and document automation).

## 🧱 Stack Used

- [x] [Microsoft Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com) (UI)  
- [x] [SharePoint](https://sharepoint.com) (data backend)
