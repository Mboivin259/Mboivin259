I'm currently learning Microsoft Power Platform (Power Apps, SharePoint, Power Automate) as part of a personal and professional development journey.

## 🔧 Project in Progress

## 🧱 Stack Used

- [x] [Microsoft Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com) (UI)

## 🎯 Objective
Create a working no-code solution using Microsoft 365 tools to manage real-world workflows with document generation and approval tracking.
