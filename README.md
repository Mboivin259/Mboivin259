# 👋 Welcome — No-code Power Platform Learner

## About Me
I'm currently learning Microsoft Power Platform (Power Apps, SharePoint, Power Automate) as part of a personal and professional development journey.

## 🔧 Project in Progress
I'm building a no-code business application prototype to manage administrative workflows (qualification requests, commissions, and document automation).

## 🧱 Stack Used

- [x] [Microsoft Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com) (UI)  
- [x] [SharePoint](https://sharepoint.com) (data backend)  
- [x] [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com) (workflow)  
- [ ] [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) (future reporting)  
- [x] GitHub (project documentation)

## 🎯 Objective
Create a working no-code solution using Microsoft 365 tools to manage real-world workflows with document generation and approval tracking.

This profile and repository are part of my experimentation and learning process.

✅ Sandbox for a Microsoft 365 Developer Program subscription access requested — awaiting approval.
